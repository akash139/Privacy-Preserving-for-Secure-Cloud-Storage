r can generate tags for multiple file
blocks in terms of a single response value. However,
that doesn?t mean the responses from multiple clouds
can be also combined into a single value on the
client side. For lack of homomorphic responses, clients
must invoke the PDP protocol repeatedly to check
the integrity of file blocks stored in multiple cloud
servers. Also, clients need to know the exact position
of each file block in a multi-cloud environment. In
addition, the verification process in such a case will
lead to high communication overheads and computation
costs at client sides as well. Therefore, it is of
utmost necessary to design a cooperative PDP model
to reduce the storage and network overheads and
enhance the transparency of verification activities in
cluster-based cloud storage systems. Moreover, such a
cooperative PDP scheme should provide features for
timely detecting abnormality and renewing multiple
copies of data.
Even though existing PDP schemes have addressed
various security properties, such as public verifiability
[2], dynamics [5], scalability [4], and privacy
preservation [7], we still need a careful consideration
of some potential attacks, including two major categories:
Data Leakage Attack by which an adversary
can easily obtain the stored data through verification
process after running or wiretapping sufficient
verification communications (see Attacks 1 and 3 in
Appendix A), and Tag Fo
