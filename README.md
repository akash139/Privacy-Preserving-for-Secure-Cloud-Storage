# Privacy-Preserving-for-Secure-Cloud-Storage

The objective of the project is that users should be able to just use the cloud storage as if it is local, without worrying about data integrity. Thus, enabling public auditing for cloud storage is of critical importance so that users can resort to a third-party auditor (TPA) to check the integrity of outsourced data and be worry-free.
