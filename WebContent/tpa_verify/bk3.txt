rgery Attack by which a
dishonest CSP can deceive the clients (see Attacks 2
and 4 in Appendix A). These two attacks may cause
potential risks for privacy leakage and ownership
cheating. Also, these attacks can more easily compromise
the security of a distributed cloud system than
that of a single cloud system.
Although various security models have been proposed
for existing PDP schemes [2], [7], [6], these
models still cannot cover all security requirements,
especially for provable secure privacy preservation
and ownership authentication. To establish a highly
effective security model, it is necessary to analyze the
PDP scheme within the framework of zero-knowledge
proof system (ZKPS) due to the reason that PDP
system is essentially an interactive proof system (IPS),
which has been well studied in the cryptography community.
In summary, a verification scheme for data
integrity in distributed storage environments should
have the following features:
? Usability aspect: A client should utilize the
integrity check in the way of collaboration services.
The scheme should conceal the details of the storage
to reduce the burden on clients;
? Security aspect: The scheme should provide adequate
security features to resist some existing attacks,
such as data leakage attack and tag forgery attack;
? Performance aspect: The scheme should have
the lower communication and computation overheads
than non-cooperative solution.
