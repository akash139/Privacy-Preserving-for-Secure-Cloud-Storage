THE JAVA 2 ENTERPRISE EDITION

The Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), has rapidly established a new programming model for developing distributed applications. This model is based on well-defined components that can automatically take advantage of sophisticated platform services. These components can be developed according to standard guidelines, combined into applications, deployed on a variety of compatible server products, and reused for maximum programmer productivity. This model is intended to both standardize and simplify the kind of distributed applications required for today's networked information economy.


J2EE Platform Benefits 

 With features designed to expedite the process of developing distributed applications, the J2EE platform offers several benefits:
?	Simplified architecture and development 
?	Freedom of choice in servers, tools, and components 
?	Integration with existing information systems 
?	Scalability to meet demand variations 
?	Flexible security model
