IN recent years, cloud storage service has become a
faster profit growth point by providing a comparably
low-cost, scalable, position-independent platform
for clients’ data. Since cloud computing environment
is constructed based on open architectures and interfaces,
it has the capability to incorporate multiple internal
and/or external cloud services together to provide
high interoperability. We call such a distributed
cloud environment as a multi-Cloud (or hybrid cloud).
Often, by using virtual infrastructure management
(VIM) [1], a multi-cloud allows clients to easily access
his/her resources remotely through interfaces such as
Web services provided by Amazon EC2.
There exist various tools and technologies for multicloud,
such as Platform VM Orchestrator, VMware
vSphere, and Ovirt. These tools help cloud providers
construct a distributed cloud storage platform (DCSP)
for managing clients’ data. However, if such an important
